       "'The sentence presents factual information without expressing favoritism or promoting one candidate over the other. It mentions Biden\\'s call for the soccer team to continue their fight for equal pay, which is a factual statement, and does not include any language that suggests the writer\\'s support or opposition to Biden\\'s stance. The sentence avoids taking sides and presents a neutral description of events, making it NOT BIASED.\\n\\nInstruction: \\'The president’s likely opponent in the November elections, Democrat Joe Biden, was not among those who were inspired. Instead, tone-deaf as he is to the American people and the things of the Spirit, he said the president’s appearance outside the church shows he “is more interested in power than in principle.”\\'\\n\\nClassify the sentence above as BIASED or NOT BIASED.\\n\\nOutput: Let\\'s think step by step. The sentence is biased because it uses loaded language like \"tone-deaf\" and \"things of the Spirit\" to negatively frame Joe Biden’s character and his understanding of public sentiment while implicitly implying that being \"inspired\" by the president\\'s actions is the normative or rightful reaction.'"
