In this reannotation round, we reannotated sentences where GPT-4 disagreed (miscalsified) the original (human) BABE labels. We did so because we sampled few examples and we saw that some original albels are worse than the GPT-4. In total we reannotated 771 sentences. In this directory we update the BABE daataset with those reannotations (around ~250 sentences changed label) and upload to huggingface.
