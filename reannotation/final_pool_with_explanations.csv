"So Acevedo’s war on gun shows would do little to prevent criminals from getting guns, but it might keep a grandpa from buying a shotgun he was going to use to duck hunt with his grandson.",BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it contains subjective opinions and non-neutral language. Phrasing like ""Acevedo’s war on gun shows"" uses emotive language to portray opposition to gun shows negatively. It also presents a speculative outcome as fact (""would do little to prevent criminals from getting guns"") without providing evidence, and it uses a sentimental example of a grandpa, presumably a law-abiding citizen, whose innocent intentions would be thwarted, thereby suggesting the policy is unreasonable without considering its broader intent or effect."
"The 2010s saw the U.S. economy achieve its longest-ever expansion, with notable milestones such as 110 months of uninterrupted job gains and an unemployment rate near a half-century low becoming easy bragging points for politicians and economists alike.",BIASED,"The sentence is labeled as biased because it selectively highlights positive economic outcomes from the 2010s, such as the record expansion and low unemployment, implying a favorable interpretation. It employs terms like ""notable milestones"" and ""easy bragging points,"" which suggest pride and achievement without acknowledging any negative aspects or challenges that occurred during the same period. The phrasing could be seen as favoring a particular political or economic narrative that emphasizes success without a balanced view of the era’s complexities."
"Retailers are ramping up hiring for positions ranging from the warehouse to the checkout counter, as delivery and service workers increasingly become indispensable to Americans largely confined to their homes because of concerns about the coronavirus.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence is fact-based, stating current actions (retailers hiring more staff) and providing a reason (increased demand due to people staying home because of COVID-19 concerns). It does not contain language that favors one viewpoint or displays prejudice. Instead, it offers a straightforward explanation of industry response to consumer behavior influenced by the pandemic. The objective tone and lack of emotional or opinionated language contribute to its classification as not biased."
"The New York state Sen. Jacobs also, in August 2017, criticized President Trump’s decision not to declare the opioid crisis a “national emergency.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents a factual account of an event without using emotive language or subjective commentary. It reports on a specific action taken by Senator Jacobs (criticizing President Trump) and describes the subject of the criticism (the decision not to declare the opioid crisis a national emergency), without offering personal opinions or judgments on either individual's actions. The neutral presentation of the information allows readers to form their own opinions without being influenced by the writer's perspective."
"President Donald Trump on Sunday briefly acknowledged losing the U.S. election in a morning Twitter post but then backtracked, saying he concedes “nothing” and vowing to keep up a court fight that election-law experts say is unlikely to succeed.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence is classified as NOT BIASED because it presents facts without emitting judgment or expressing a particular viewpoint. It reports President Donald Trump's actions and statements on Twitter concerning the election results and notes legal experts' opinions on the likely success of his court challenges. The language used is neutral, sticking to reporting what happened without inserting subjective commentary or emotive expressions that could indicate bias."
Trump’s latest anti-China barb came as new figures showed 30 million Americans have lost their jobs during lockdown.,BIASED,"The sentence uses the term ""barb,"" which implies a sharp, critical attack, suggesting a negative and hostile action. This word choice conveys disapproval and assigns a confrontational tone to Trump’s remarks, reflecting a subjective judgement. Additionally, linking Trump's comments directly with the job loss figures implies causation or correlation without providing context or evidence, suggesting that his rhetoric might have a role in the economic situation. Both elements introduce subjectivity, making the sentence appear biased."
"On the first point, Vox had a good piece yesterday noting that ISIS territory is only one piece of a larger puzzle.",BIASED,"The sentence suggests that the information from Vox is particularly noteworthy or valuable (""had a good piece""), which implies a positive evaluation of the source. By qualifying Vox's article as 'good', it indicates a subjective judgment that reflects the writer’s opinion or preference toward Vox's coverage. This use of evaluative language introduces bias by endorsing the credibility or quality of Vox over other sources without providing evidence or rationale for this judgment. Bias can arise from the use of adjectives that convey approval or disapproval, leading readers to trust one source over others."
We finally know what it takes to get the House to examine gun violence: it’s not a mass shooting; it’s an election.,BIASED,"The sentence above is classified as biased because it contains a judgment that implies members of the House prioritize electoral concerns over public safety, suggesting they are unresponsive to mass shootings unless it affects their chances of reelection. It presents a subjective opinion about lawmakers' motivations rather than a neutral statement of fact, therefore displaying a partisan slant and potentially perpetuating a specific negative narrative about the House's response to gun violence. Bias is evident in the framing of the issue around alleged political self-interest rather than policy deliberation."
Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said white people should apologise for the treatment of black people on a night when Premier League players wore the slogan “Black Lives Matter” on their shirts.,NOT BIASED,"The sentence appears to provide a straightforward report on comments made by a public figure, Pep Guardiola, without inserting subjective language, interpretation, or opinion. It also gives context by noting that the statement was made during an event where Premier League players wore ""Black Lives Matter"" slogans, which offers factual background without editorializing. The sentence relays information without attempting to persuade the reader to adopt a particular viewpoint on the issue, thus maintaining a neutral stance."
"When two sadists in uniform shoved an elderly man to the ground for the crime of approaching them, causing him a critical head injury, their fellow cops made no attempt to help the victim. ",BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it uses emotionally charged language like ""sadists in uniform"" and ""shoved an elderly man to the ground"" to convey disapproval and imply malicious intent on the part of the police officers. Impartial reporting would stick to neutral terms and avoid suggesting character traits or intentions unless objectively proven. It also presumes guilt (""for the crime of approaching them"") without discussing the context or legal outcomes. Lastly, the phrase ""their fellow cops"" generalizes the actions of some, potentially implying group culpability without evidence that all officers behaved similarly. Bias is present in the depiction of events with subjective language and unfounded generalizations."
"Scientists have also noted that, unlike peer-reviewed scientific studies, the US intelligence assessments being debated do not provide public transparency about how they reached their conclusions or the evidence they accumulated.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence is factual and comparative in nature, contrasting the methods of scientific studies with US intelligence assessments without expressing a preference for one over the other. It objectively outlines a procedural difference—peer-reviewed studies offer transparency about their methodologies and evidence, while intelligence assessments do not publicize this information—without implying judgment on the value or correctness of either approach."
"Nelson and her attorneys, two of whom are from the Alliance Defending Freedom — a conservative Christian legal group that has fought against LGBTQ rights for decades — are asking the court to block enforcement of the Louisville law, known as a fairness ordinance, so Nelson would not have to photograph same-sex weddings.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents factual information without expressing subjective judgments or emotionally charged language. It states who is involved (Nelson and her attorneys), their association (Alliance Defending Freedom), the nature of the legal group (conservative Christian legal group), their past actions (fought against LGBTQ rights), the action being taken (asking the court to block enforcement), and the reason (so Nelson would not have to photograph same-sex weddings). All these elements are presented neutrally, sticking to information that can be verified without taking a position on the issue, making it not biased."
"This message of depending on the State for security might seem like an odd fit with the Democrats’ “Abolish the Police” mania, and it’s certainly hard to sell abolishing the police with a side order of draconian gun laws to thinking Americans – but remember, the Left isn’t terribly interested in persuading anyone, and will feel secure in its power after a big election victory. ",BIASED,"The statement is biased because it presents opinions as facts without providing evidence, uses politically charged terms like ""mania"" to describe policy positions, and implies that a political group (the Left) is monolithic in its intent to avoid persuasion and secure power. This language suggests a subjective viewpoint and a generalization of a diverse group's motives and policies, endorsing a specific ideological perspective without a balanced discussion."
Marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman.,BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it presents a narrow definition of marriage as exclusively between a man and a woman, thereby excluding same-sex couples and non-binary individuals. Implicit within this statement is the assumption that other forms of marriage are less valid or important, which reflects a particular cultural or religious viewpoint rather than a universal truth. The use of the word ""sacred"" further implies a moral or religious judgment that may not be shared by all individuals or societies."
"U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday promoted her ambitious welfare legislation to constituents in her home district in New York, finding a friendlier audience than she often encounters in the glare of Washington.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence simply states a factual occurrence (Ocasio-Cortez promoting legislation), the location (her district), and contrasts the audience reception between her district and Washington. It doesn't contain adjectives or adverbs that carry positive or negative connotations towards her or her actions, nor does it editorialize her policies or character. The information is presented without language that suggests approval or disapproval, allowing readers to form their own opinions based on the facts presented."
"Speaking to host Trevor Noah, Obama sang the praises of BLM activists who have pushed for police departments around the country to be stripped of public funding.",BIASED,"The sentence contains biased language with the phrase ""sang the praises of BLM activists,"" which implies unequivocal approval, and ""stripped of public funding,"" which carries a negative connotation suggesting harm or deprivation. The choice of words promotes a particular viewpoint that endorses the activists' actions and frames the defunding police narrative as detrimental, without providing a neutral or balanced perspective. Such language can influence the reader's perception by subtly presenting the activists in a positive light and the defunding as negative, rather than objectively describing the events."
"Security measures are in place as there are concerns radical groups could face off in Richmond, but Democrat office holders and their surrogates in the gun control movement, as well as establishment media reporters, are working hard to paint the entire gun rally as a meeting of extremists and racists.",BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it employs loaded language such as ""radical groups,"" ""surrogates in the gun control movement,"" and ""establishment media reporters"" to cast these entities in a negative light. It suggests, without supporting evidence, that Democrat officeholders and their allies are actively and unfairly trying to portray the gun rally attendees as ""extremists and racists."" This introduces a subjective angle that implies a coordinated smear campaign, thus undermining the legitimacy of the concern for public safety and the motives of the gun control movement and journalists."
"The gun lobby has repeatedly claimed that using a gun in self-defense is a common event, often going so far as to allege that Americans defend themselves with guns millions of times a year.",BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it employs emotive language by using phrases like ""repeatedly claimed"" and ""often going so far as to allege,"" which suggest a pattern of exaggeration or misinformation by the gun lobby without providing specific evidence. The use of ""millions of times a year"" in a way that implies disbelief also contributes to the perception that the claim is inherently implausible or exaggerated. This characterization appears to discredit the gun lobby's statements without offering a balanced view or acknowledging the existence of differing statistics or perspectives on the issue."
When did it become racist to like the national anthem and Mount Rushmore?,BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it implies a false premise that appreciating the national anthem and Mount Rushmore is widely considered racist, which suggests biased framing and a potential agenda. This assertion may reflect an attempt to discredit those who argue that certain aspects of these symbols can be problematic or have controversial histories by exaggerating and mischaracterizing their positions as universally labeling any appreciation as racist. The sentence appeals to emotions and attempts to polarize rather than presenting a neutral inquiry or fact."
"At the dawn of the year 2010, few Americans could predict that the coming decade would revolutionize the legal and cultural landscape for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents a factual observation about unpredictability concerning changes for LGBTQ individuals without expressing a subjective opinion or preference. It states that a significant transformation occurred, which is supported by factual events such as the legalization of same-sex marriage and increased societal acceptance, without advocating for or against these changes, thereby maintaining neutrality."
"Though the state remains a hothouse for high-tech and media startups, thousands of companies left the state due to its high taxes, heavy regulations, and litigious environment.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence is considered not biased because it presents a fact-based observation without expressing a preference for or against the state's policies. It acknowledges the state's positive aspect as a ""hothouse for high-tech and media startups,"" while also stating the factual outcome of businesses leaving due to ""high taxes, heavy regulations, and litigious environment."" It does not use emotive language or judgmental terms that would indicate a bias, instead providing a balanced depiction of the situation."
"Watching a crazed mob tear down the statue of Christopher Columbus in Pelosi’s native Baltimore on July 4, it was impossible to believe an earlier generation of Democratic leaders would have allowed such destruction.",BIASED,"The sentence expresses bias as it implies a negative judgment on contemporary Democratic leaders by unfavorably comparing them to past ones, suggesting that the past leaders would not have ""allowed"" the event described. It also uses emotionally charged language like ""crazed mob"" and ""destruction,"" indicating disapproval of the actions rather than providing a neutral account. The framing presents the tearing down of the statue as universally negative, disregarding any broader context or differing viewpoints on the incident."
"For the latest grisly example of hypocrisy, “progressive” cronyism, feminist cry-bullying, and Deep State entrenchment, look no further than Britain’s Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies.",BIASED,"The sentence contains emotionally charged language and unsubstantiated accusations, such as ""grisly example,"" ""hypocrisy,"" ""cronyism,"" ""feminist cry-bullying,"" and ""Deep State entrenchment."" It also uses quotation marks to cast doubt on the term ""progressive."" Such language choices are indicative of a subjective viewpoint and are aimed at discrediting Dame Sally Davies without providing evidence. This strong negative framing is designed to persuade the reader to adopt a similar critical stance, instead of presenting an objective analysis. Bias is evident in the one-sided negative portrayal and the lack of neutral, factual reporting."
President Donald Trump fueled controversy on Monday over his decision to kill Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani by saying “it doesn’t really matter” whether Soleimani posed an imminent threat to the United States.,NOT BIASED,"The sentence reports a factual event (Trump's statement) without using charged or emotive language. It presents what was said by Trump without providing opinion, interpretation, or judgment. It stays neutral by simply conveying the subject of controversy related to a political figure's decision and public comment."
"In reality, the Trump administration implemented Operation Warp Speed, which created a public-private partnership to fast-track a coronavirus vaccine.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence is classified as not biased because it presents a factual statement without expressing opinions or favoritism. It describes Operation Warp Speed as a program initiated by the Trump administration to accelerate vaccine development, identifying it as a ""public-private partnership"" without positive or negative connotations, indicating an objective report of an event or policy."
"Michael Mann, arguably the world’s no. 1 climate alarmist, goes on to make proclamations that only a publication as ideologically compromised as the Guardian would think to publish.",BIASED,"The sentence is biased as it contains several subjective statements that discredit both Michael Mann and The Guardian without providing evidence. Words like ""arguably the world’s no. 1 climate alarmist"" suggest a negative portrayal of Mann's opinions on climate, implying exaggeration without substantiation. Additionally, describing The Guardian as ""ideologically compromised"" assumes it lacks integrity in its publications, casting aspersions on the newspaper's credibility based on ideology rather than journalistic practice. This framing suggests a dismissive attitude towards both parties before considering the content of their claims."
Democrats have seethed as they helplessly watched the Trump administration undo or block a slew of Obama-era environmental proposals during the past two years.,BIASED,"The sentence is biased due to its use of emotionally charged language such as ""seethed"" and ""helplessly watched,"" which implies a strong negative emotion and powerlessness on the part of Democrats, and the phrase ""slew of Obama-era environmental proposals,"" suggesting that the Trump administration is engaging in widespread or aggressive reversals. This choice of words conveys a subjective opinion and suggests an alignment with the perspective of the Democrats without providing a neutral representation of the actions of the Trump administration."
"The president’s likely opponent in the November elections, Democrat Joe Biden, was not among those who were inspired. Instead, tone-deaf as he is to the American people and the things of the Spirit, he said the president’s appearance outside the church shows he “is more interested in power than in principle.”",BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it uses loaded language like ""tone-deaf"" and ""things of the Spirit"" to negatively frame Joe Biden’s character and his understanding of public sentiment while implicitly implying that being ""inspired"" by the president's actions is the normative or rightful reaction. The text editorializes Biden's response with subjective judgments rather than presenting a neutral description of events or statements from both sides."
"Since then, the “Black Lives Matter” movement – sparked by the killing of black teen Trayvon Martin by civilian George Zimmerman in Florida in 2012 – has become closely associated with critiques of overly aggressive policing, particularly against black people.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence provides a factual account of the origin of the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement, naming the incident and individuals involved without expressing a subjective opinion. It states the broader public perception of the movement's focus on aggressive policing against black individuals, a widely documented concern, without endorsing or denouncing the views. Thus, it presents information neutrally without promoting a particular standpoint or interpretation."
"Opposition to immunizations was once largely limited to online bullying, but now opponents are increasingly taking their harassment tactics into the real world: aggressively following legislators and doctors and, in some cases, using physical violence.",BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it employs emotionally charged language such as ""online bullying,"" ""aggressively following,"" and ""using physical violence,"" which casts immunization opponents in a strongly negative light. It suggests a generalized shift from passive to active harassment without providing evidence of the prevalence or extent of such behavior, implying it is widespread without substantiation. Additionally, by not acknowledging any legitimate concerns or reasons people might have for opposing immunizations, it paints all opponents with the same brush, potentially oversimplifying a diverse group."
A Black policewoman was injured and at least four people stabbed when a day of demonstrations in support of President Donald Trump's election delusions ended in violence Saturday night in Washington D.C. ,BIASED,"The sentence displays bias through the use of charged language. The term ""election delusions"" implies a judgement on the legitimacy of Trump’s claims, portraying them as irrational without providing evidence. Describing the demonstrations in a negative light by focusing only on the violent outcomes, without acknowledging any peaceful elements, can also signal bias. Additionally, the phrasing does not attempt to offer a neutral or balanced depiction of the events or the individuals involved, thereby conveying a subjective perspective rather than an objective report."
"Top Trump administration officials told lawmakers Tuesday that U.S. military deployments in the Middle East were purely defensive and not aimed at provoking a war with Iran, amid growing concerns in Congress about a possible military conflict.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence states facts about what Trump administration officials told lawmakers, without using emotionally charged language or expressing an opinion on the matter. It presents the officials' stated position on military deployments without endorsing or challenging it, thereby maintaining a neutral tone. It also acknowledges the context of congressional concerns without attributing motives, allowing readers to draw their own conclusions based on the information provided."
Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) whined about Breitbart News’ coverage of illegal immigrants and Muslim refugees during his recent commencement address at Cambridge College.,BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it uses opinionated language that carries a negative connotation. The word ""whined"" implies that Rep. Luis Gutierrez’s complaints were petty or unjustified, rather than considering his perspective as valid or worth discussing. The description paints his actions in a negative light without providing context or evidence, and it presupposes that Breitbart News' coverage is fair and unbiased, which may not be universally accepted. This language choice shows subjectivity and aims to discredit the individual rather than neutrally reporting on the event."
Conservative activists and L.G.B.T. groups agree that religious liberty cases could be the most potent challenges to same-sex marriage and other issues concerning gay and transgender people.,NOT BIASED,"The sentence is factual and reports on a perspective shared by two different groups, conservative activists and L.G.B.T. groups, without favoring one side or the other. It states a shared belief regarding the impact of religious liberty cases on issues concerning gay and transgender people, without offering opinion or judgment. This neutral framing presents the issue as a matter of legal contention without appearing to endorse or condemn any particular viewpoint, thus maintaining objectivity."
"He was relaxed and confident enough to engage in some unplanned improvisation, sharing with the world what he finds funny.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents factual observations about the subject's behavior (relaxation, confidence) and actions (engaging in unplanned improvisation, sharing his sense of humor) without imparting any judgment or subjective opinion. It simply describes what he did, without any words that suggest approval or disapproval, making it a neutral statement rather than a biased one. Bias would imply a predisposition towards a particular viewpoint or an unfair presentation of information, which this sentence avoids by sticking to descriptive, objective language."
"The George Floyd protests took a global turn over the weekend as Antifa and Black Lives Matter activists took to the streets of London to ‘stand up to racism’ and to celebrate the riots engulfing the United States, which they claim is a signal that “the West is falling”.",BIASED,"This sentence is biased because it uses charged language that implies a negative view of the protests, such as ""celebrate the riots,"" suggesting that activists were happy about violence and chaos. It also includes the phrase ""the West is falling,"" indicating a drastic and ominous interpretation without substantiation, implying an agenda beyond the factual reporting of events. Additionally, it attributes intentions to activists (""stand up to racism"") alongside a contentious claim (""celebrate the riots""), which can influence readers' perceptions without providing nuanced perspectives or evidence of motivations."
"As more and more South Koreans were released from treatment for COVID-19, authorities discovered a disturbing trend. Some ostensibly cured patients were later testing positive again.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence is considered not biased because it conveys information factually without promoting a particular viewpoint, opinion, or emotion. It simply reports an observation made by authorities regarding the recurrence of positive COVID-19 tests in patients previously deemed cured, without assigning blame or suggesting underlying causes. The language is neutral and presents the information without persuasive elements or subjective commentary."
"But Trump has a track record of flouting scientific advice and some experts are skeptical that vaccine trials, which have to study potential side effects on a wide range of people before they can deliver a verdict, can be completed by late this year or even early next year.",BIASED,"The sentence displays bias through the use of charged language, namely ""flouting scientific advice,"" which suggests a disregard or contempt for expert guidance. This phrase carries a negative connotation and implies a judgment of character. Additionally, the sentence frames experts as uniformly skeptical regarding the feasibility of the vaccine timeline, ignoring any differing opinions within the scientific community. By focusing only on skepticism, the sentence presents a one-sided view without acknowledging the full spectrum of expert perspectives. This selective presentation of information contributes to the perceived bias."
The Supreme Court's increasingly fervent support for religious freedom was extended Thursday to three Muslim men placed on a no-fly list as punishment for refusing to become government informants.,NOT BIASED,"The sentence sticks to reporting factual information without using emotionally charged language or expressing opinions. It conveys the Supreme Court's action regarding religious freedom, the affected individuals' religion, and the reason for their no-fly list placement, all without taking a stance. The use of ""increasingly fervent support"" is a non-judgmental observation of a trend in court decisions rather than a subjective comment. Thus, it maintains a neutral tone and sticks to stating the events, which keeps it free from bias."
The “Muslim ban” exists only in the minds of Democrats and left-wing journalists.,BIASED,"The sentence exhibits bias by suggesting that only Democrats and left-wing journalists believe in the existence of a ""Muslim ban,"" implying that such belief is groundless and politically motivated. The phrase dismisses concerns without considering the factual basis for why some people perceive certain travel restrictions as targeting Muslim-majority countries. The statement also polarizes the issue along partisan lines, dismissing the possibility that people across the political spectrum could have legitimate concerns about the policy. Bias is evident in the use of the term ""only"" and in assuming that the belief is a mere figment rather than a subject of genuine debate."
We should expect growing support for this item for a few reasons: Younger voters of all political stripes are being exposed to the status quo student loan system. Younger voters are also less likely to accept the toxic brand of “conservatism.” ,BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it makes value-laden statements. It implies that the current student loan system is negative by referring to it as ""status quo,"" suggesting a need for change, and it assumes that younger voters are universally dissatisfied with it. Additionally, describing ""conservatism"" as a ""toxic brand"" is a subjective judgment that conveys a negative opinion without acknowledging the diversity of conservative thought or that conservative perspectives on student loans can be legitimate. These elements show a partial perspective that favors certain political and social views."
"In an article posted by NBC News on Monday, the AP argues that even erstwhile allies, like tennis great and gay activist Martina Navratilova, can become resentful of transgender women dominating their sport.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence neutrally reports a statement attributed to the AP without expressing an opinion or taking sides on the issue. It mentions Martina Navratilova, a known public figure, and her stance, which is contextualized with her background in both tennis and gay activism. The sentence simply states that there is a potential for resentment towards transgender women in sports, without endorsing or condemning this view. This objective conveyance of what was reported by NBC News regarding the AP's argument is why the sentence is classified as not biased."
Anti-racism activists poured red paint on a statue of an Italian colonial-era general and pasted over the name of a street in Rome on Friday to show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States.,NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents facts without subjective language or judgement. It describes the actions taken by the activists (pouring paint and pasting over a name) and states their intent (to show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement) without rhetoric that promotes or condemns the behavior. It does not provide analysis or opinion, allowing readers to interpret the events on their own. Thus, it maintains a neutral and descriptive tone, characteristic of unbiased reporting."
"Turner, a black woman herself, criticized Biden and argued that Sanders is a better choice for black voters across the country.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents a factual statement without expressing subjective judgement or preference. It describes an action performed by Turner (criticizing Biden) and states her opinion that Sanders is a better choice, without endorsing or opposing her view. The sentence merely reports on Turner's stance without any language that suggests the writer's agreement or disagreement, making it a neutral description of events."
The group claims “systemic racism” has made it difficult for black individuals to obtain birth control and enjoy “reproductive freedom.”,BIASED,"The sentence above is classified as biased because it presents the group's claim without any backing evidence or a balanced perspective. The use of quotation marks around ""systemic racism"" and ""reproductive freedom"" can imply skepticism or disbelief regarding the terms' legitimacy. Furthermore, attributing the difficulty in obtaining birth control solely to systemic racism could oversimplify a complex issue. Without context, the sentence may seem to suggest a one-sided view that ignores other factors that could contribute to the problem."
"But, she told The Daily Beast, she tries to read stories about climate solutions as much as she can.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents a fact about an individual's reading habits without expressing a subjective opinion, judgment, or favoritism towards a particular side of the climate debate. Reporting on someone's personal action—especially when it relates to their choice of reading material—does not imply a bias; it merely acknowledges what the person does. The use of the source, ""The Daily Beast,"" does not inherently convey bias unless the context of the quotation or the publication's treatment of the story shows partiality. Without additional context suggesting bias, the sentence is classified as not biased."
"A victory by Biden and his vice presidential running mate Kamala Harris, who favor increased gun regulation, could further stoke demand for firearms - and shares of firearms makers - particularly if Democrats wrest control of the Senate from Republicans, giving them majorities in both houses of Congress and making it easier to approve legislation.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents a fact-based scenario without indicating a preference or delivering a judgment. It discusses the potential outcome (increased demand for firearms and shares of firearms makers) of a political victory based on the stated policy positions (favoring increased gun regulation) of Biden and Harris, and the potential shift in legislative power (Democrats controlling both houses). The explanation is rooted in logical causation: policies favored by the victors could lead to certain market reactions. It doesn't use emotive or loaded language but sticks to a straightforward prediction of cause and effect."
"Naturally, of course, right-wingers reacted in the ugliest way possible: By arguing that Thunberg’s identity — as a young person, as a person on the autism spectrum and, although they are careful not to say this directly, as a girl — inherently discredits what she has to say.",BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it makes a generalized negative assumption about ""right-wingers,"" suggesting they uniformly react in the ""ugliest way possible,"" discrediting Greta Thunberg based on her age, autism, and gender. This broad characterization does not account for varied perspectives within a political group and presupposes a malicious intent without specific evidence. It uses emotionally charged language (""ugliest way"") that portrays one side as inherently wrong or villainous, rather than presenting a neutral or balanced viewpoint. Bias is evident in the tone and the sweeping generalization about a group's reaction to Thunberg’s activism."
Drowned out by the algorithm: Vaccination advocates struggle to be heard online,NOT BIASED,"The sentence ""Drowned out by the algorithm: Vaccination advocates struggle to be heard online"" presents an observation without taking a stance or expressing a value judgment. It states a perceived challenge faced by vaccination advocates in terms of visibility in online platforms, attributed to algorithmic filtering, without affirming or disputing the validity of their advocacy. It does not contain loaded language or imply that one side of the vaccination debate is more valid than the other, hence it is considered not biased."
"In fact, the constant GOP refrain about the border being ‘open’ may actually be aggravating the problem by disseminating the impression around the globe that it’s worth making the attempt to get into the United States.”",BIASED,"The sentence exhibits bias as it assumes a causative relationship between GOP rhetoric and increased attempts to enter the US without providing evidence. By attributing the issue to a political party's statements, it suggests intention or fault without a neutral examination of the problem's complexities. Additionally, the use of quotation marks around 'open' implies a skepticism towards the GOP's position, further indicating a subjective stance rather than an impartial one. Bias in this context may influence the reader by framing the political debate in a way that implicitly critiques one side's perspective."
"While many women, and the men who love them, are well aware that, spurred on by the Vatican, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) and the so-called personhood movement, Republicans are working feverishly to eradicate women’s reproductive rights.",BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it uses loaded language that suggests a pejorative assessment without providing a balanced perspective. Phrases like ""spurred on by the Vatican"" and ""so-called personhood movement"" imply negative motivation or illegitimacy. The word ""feverishly"" portrays Republicans as overly intense or extreme in their efforts. This language choice frames the subject with an implied criticism and assumes a particular viewpoint, rather than presenting information in a neutral or objective manner."
"Romania's government, in trying to soften anti-corruption laws, is fanning the flames of nationalism by criticizing the presence of foreigners at protests.",BIASED,"The sentence above is classified as BIased because it contains value-laden language and portrays a negative perspective without providing a neutral viewpoint. Terms like ""soften anti-corruption laws"" suggest a dilution of integrity, and ""fanning the flames of nationalism"" implies deliberate exacerbation of divisive sentiments. Additionally, criticizing ""the presence of foreigners at protests"" as a negative action presupposes that such criticism is inherently unjust, rather than explaining the context or rationale. This combination of emotive language and lack of objectivity reveals an underlying bias.
"
"Rhode Island’s oldest mosque was only threatened, while others in Florida and Texas were set ablaze in cases ruled arson.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents factual statements without employing language that leans towards a particular view, opinion, or stereotype. It reports on incidents involving mosques factually by distinguishing between one that was threatened and others that were actually burned, with the cases determined as arson. The use of the verb ""threatened"" for Rhode Island and ""set ablaze"" for Florida and Texas illustrates different levels of harm without assigning blame or motive. Thus, it avoids taking a side or pushing a particular agenda, which would be characteristic of a biased statement."
Big-money donors seem to have activated their astroturf groups to get people out in the streets to make sure that Trump feels the pressure from his beloved base to open up the economy.,BIASED,"The sentence shows bias as it presents the involvement of 'big-money donors' and 'astroturf groups' in a pejorative light, suggesting manipulation rather than genuine grassroots activism. The phrase 'beloved base' also implies sarcasm or derision toward Trump's supporters, making the statement seem partial against Trump and his followers. Additionally, the word 'pressure' implies a forceful influence rather than voluntary support, which further signifies a negative portrayal of the situation, suggesting an agenda contrary to an objective report of events."
"Australian sports stars, sparked in part by a call to action from tennis player Nick Kyrgios, have rallied to raise funds in support of relief and recovery efforts for victims of the country’s bushfire catastrophe.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence is not biased because it presents factual information without expressing a subjective opinion, persuasion, or emotional language. It states the action taken by Australian sports stars, attributes the catalyst to Nick Kyrgios's call to action, and describes the purpose—support for bushfire relief efforts—without favoritism or judgment."
ABC 7 reported that the shootings began about 6 p.m. Friday and continued until just before midnight Sunday.,NOT BIASED,"The sentence is factual and devoid of emotional language or subjective commentary. It simply states the time period during which the shootings occurred, as reported by a news source (ABC 7). The lack of adjectives, adverbs, or phrases that could imply a judgement or slant ensures the neutrality of the statement. Providing such straightforward information about an event without expressing an opinion or promoting a particular viewpoint is indicative of an unbiased report."
"Protests, including in Portland, have at times erupted into arson and violence, and federal officers sent into the Northwestern city have repeatedly clashed with crowds targeting the federal courthouse there.",NOT BIASED,"The statement presents factual observations without loaded language, subjective claims, or unsupported judgments. It reports on specific events (protests, arson, violence), locations (Portland), actions (federal officers clashing with crowds), and targets (federal courthouse) without inferring motive or casting aspersions on any group's character. It sticks to describing what has occurred, avoiding any language that implies an opinion or takes a side in the matter."
Redfield—usually a reliable Trump sycophant—admitted that some recent cases that had been written off as deaths due to flu were likely cases of the coronavirus.,BIASED,"The sentence is biased as it employs charged language, notably the term ""sycophant,"" which conveys a strong negative connotation of uncritical and abject flattery towards Trump, thus casting Redfield in a derogatory light. Additionally, by stating he ""admitted"" some cases were likely coronavirus, it suggests an element of prior deceit or intentional oversight. This wording presents the situation in a way that implies wrongdoing or a change of heart due to overwhelming evidence, rather than a neutral or fact-based update. The overall tone lacks neutrality, which is necessary for objective reporting."
"DeVos, like all Trump administration officials, is a Clue-caricature villain.",BIASED,"The sentence expresses a negative opinion that generalizes all Trump administration officials as ""Clue-caricature villains,"" which is a form of bias. It suggests a preconceived negative stereotype without providing specific, objective evidence. The use of the term ""villain,"" a label commonly associated with fictional characters who embody evil or wrongdoing, inherently conveys a judgmental and disparaging tone. This subjective characterization demonstrates a lack of neutrality and indicates a biased viewpoint against Betsy DeVos and her fellow Trump administration officials. Bias is indicated by the use of pejorative language and absence of a balanced perspective."
"Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage blasted Boris Johnson for failing to confront the Marxist Black Lives Matter UK movement, saying that the prime minister is “trapped” by a politically correct culture.",BIASED,"The sentence contains loaded language and subjective judgments. Terms like ""blasted"" and ""confront"" suggest confrontation and conflict. ""Marxist Black Lives Matter UK movement"" is a politically charged description implying negative connotations, likely alienating to supporters of the movement. ""Trapped by a politically correct culture"" implies weakness and suggests a negative view of sensitivity to inclusivity. These elements collectively reveal a one-sided perspective lacking neutral reporting, thereby classifying the sentence as biased."
The American middle class is falling deeper into debt to maintain a middle-class lifestyle.,NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents an economic observation without indulging in language that suggests a direct judgment or opinion. It simply states a trend regarding the relationship between debt and lifestyle maintenance amongst the American middle class. The lack of charged words or subjective phrases allows it to deliver information in a neutral manner, which is why it's classified as not biased."
"Leaders of the 20 biggest economies vowed on Sunday to spare no effort to supply COVID-19 drugs, tests and vaccines affordably and fairly to “all people”, reflecting worries that the pandemic could deepen divisions between the world’s rich and poor.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence provides a straightforward account of a commitment made by leaders without inserting opinions or favoritism. It presents an objective report of their collective promise to address a global issue, avoiding loaded language or subjective commentary that would suggest a particular viewpoint, thus maintaining neutrality."
"While conservatives may find comfort in the old saw that those who aren’t liberal at 20 have no heart, and those who aren’t conservative at 40 have no brain, the truth, as Levin knows, is that those who are statists at 20 usually end up statists at 40. And he’s not content to allow time to take its uncertain political toll. ",BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it presents opinions as facts and uses disparaging language (""statists"") to label and discredit a certain political viewpoint, suggesting a negative outcome for those who maintain that viewpoint (""usually end up statists at 40""). It assumes a negative connotation to remaining consistent in political beliefs and promotes a specific political ideology as intellectually superior after a certain age. This framing suggests a preference for conservative ideology over others and dismisses the complexity and legitimacy of different political trajectories."
The federal government under President Trump’s leadership has done a great deal to effectively respond to the crisis and support struggling Americans and their businesses.,NOT BIASED,"The sentence cannot be classified as not biased without context because it contains positive language (""done a great deal,"" ""effectively respond"") praising the federal government's actions under President Trump's leadership. It doesn't mention any criticisms or alternative viewpoints, which suggests a one-sided perspective. Typically, unbiased statements aim to present information in a neutral and balanced way, often acknowledging multiple sides of an issue. This sentence, however, reads as an endorsement of the government's actions, indicating a subjective viewpoint that seems to favor one side of the political spectrum."
"One example of a Medicaid waiver involves work rules, which require able-bodied adults to work a minimum number of hours each month or participate in an equivalent activity as a condition for continued Medicaid eligibility. ",NOT BIASED,"The sentence maintains an objective tone by stating the facts about a type of Medicaid waiver without expressing an opinion or preference regarding the policy. It simply describes the conditions under which able-bodied adults must comply to remain eligible for Medicaid. The use of terms like ""able-bodied adults,"" ""minimum number of hours,"" and ""equivalent activity"" is neutral and does not convey judgment or promote a particular agenda. It provides information without advocating for or against the work requirements, thus enabling it to be categorized as not biased."
President Donald Trump wore a mask and talked up the possibility of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year on Monday as he looked to show voters in the battleground state of North Carolina that he is responding to the pandemic.,NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents factual information without using loaded or emotive language. It describes an action by President Donald Trump (wearing a mask), states a claim he made (talking up a vaccine possibility), and provides a context for his actions (looking to show voters his response to the pandemic). The tone is neutral, and it refrains from including opinions or subjective judgments about the events described, making it a straightforward report of occurrences."
"With U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement on Thursday of tariffs on another $300 billion of Chinese imports, nearly all goods from China will be subject to import taxes, and Trump says they generate billions of dollars in revenues for the U.S. Treasury from China.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents factual information about a policy decision without using emotive language, subjective statements, or editorial commentary. It describes President Trump's announcement of tariffs and their intended financial impact based on his claims, without taking a stance on the issue or assessing the policy's merits. Such a neutral presentation of facts and direct quotations without inferential language aligns with journalistic standards of unbiased reporting."
"After a two month shutdown, professional sports slowly began to re-emerge from under the COVID-19 cloud during the weekend as several events returned to television — all without fans in attendance.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence provides factual information without promoting a particular point of view, opinion, or agenda. It describes the resumption of professional sports after a shutdown due to COVID-19 and mentions the absence of fans, which are objective elements that can be verified. The language used is neutral and does not contain loaded or emotional words that would indicate a bias."
"Though he boasted about working with some of the greatest experts in public health in the world, he demonstrated no personal knowledge of the science or the nature of the outbreak",BIASED,"The sentence is classified as biased because it implies a negative judgment of the individual's credibility, suggesting that despite his associations with renowned experts, he lacks understanding of the subject. The phrase ""boasted"" has a connotation of arrogance, and ""demonstrated no personal knowledge"" accuses the individual of ignorance without providing evidence of such a lack of understanding, thus presenting a subjective and prejudicial perspective rather than an objective statement."
"Lefty corporate financial muscle can be deployed against gun and ammunition manufacturers, making it hard for them to stay in business. ",BIASED,"The sentence above is classified as biased because it employs the term ""Lefty corporate financial muscle"" in a pejorative manner, suggesting a negative and politically slanted characterization of actions by corporations. The language implies that corporations aligned with or influenced by left-leaning ideologies are exerting undue or coercive power to hinder the operations of gun and ammunition manufacturers. The choice of words conveys a value judgment rather than a neutral description of financial activity, thus indicating a bias against those corporate actions and potentially the political ideology associated with them."
"This prohibition is but the first portion of the implementation of I-1639, the gun control initiative pushed by millionaires and billionaires and passed by voters on November 6, 2018.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence cannot objectively be classified as ""not biased"" given the framing of ""pushed by millionaires and billionaires,"" which suggests an underlying perspective that the initiative might be influenced by wealthy interests and is not solely a democratic outcome. The phrasing intimates that the financial power of these individuals is a noteworthy factor, which can carry a negative connotation about the process by which the initiative was passed. Therefore, the sentence does indeed seem to contain bias."
Donald Trump Loves the Iranian People So Much He’s Banned Them From the U.S.,BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it presents a sarcastic or ironic statement juxtaposing the expression of love with an action that would typically be associated with opposition or hostility (banning Iranians from the U.S.). It implies hypocrisy or insincerity on Donald Trump's part without providing context or acknowledging the complex nature of immigration and foreign policy decisions. The tone suggests a negative judgment, which deviates from neutral or objective reporting. Bias is evident in the use of charged language to convey an opinion rather than stating facts."
"Facebook, Google, Amazon and other large technology companies face criticism for reducing their tax bills by booking profits in low-tax countries regardless of the location of the end customer. ",NOT BIASED,"The sentence is a factual statement reporting a common criticism of these companies without taking a subjective stance or using emotionally charged language. It does not suggest the companies are wrong or right for their tax strategies, merely that they are criticized for it. The neutrality in tone and absence of persuasive language aimed at swaying the reader's opinion helps classify the sentence as not biased."
That’s why a new proposal from a bevy of progressive lawmakers comes as a welcome and innovative addition to the policy arsenal: increasing the corporate tax rate in accordance with the gap between CEO pay and median worker pay.,BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it frames a new proposal by progressive lawmakers as ""welcome and innovative,"" which implies positive judgment rather than presenting a neutral viewpoint. Furthermore, it assumes that increasing corporate tax rates based on the CEO-to-worker pay gap is a beneficial addition to policy measures, reflecting an inherent approval of this specific approach without presenting counterarguments or acknowledging potential criticisms. These subjective endorsements reveal the author's favorable stance toward the proposal and the lawmakers behind it."
"The U.S. Congress is moving to extend by another year tax breaks for beer, wine and distilled spirits worth hundreds of millions of dollars that were initially approved as part of tax reform in 2017.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents factual information without using emotive language, subjective statements, or expressing an opinion. It describes an action by the U.S. Congress (extending tax breaks), the beneficiaries of the action (beer, wine, and distilled spirits industries), and the historical context (initial approval in 2017). The sentence's neutral tone and lack of editorializing allow it to inform readers without directing them towards a particular viewpoint or conclusion, which aligns with the criteria for non-biased reporting."
"The White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) estimated that 13 million Americans will have increased access to health care due to President Donald Trump’s executive action, according to a report released recently.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents a factual statement, citing a specific report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) regarding the impact of an executive action by President Donald Trump. It does not contain any adjectives or adverbs that display a clear positive or negative attitude towards the action or the individuals involved. The sentence reports the estimated effect of the action (increased access to healthcare for 13 million Americans) without expressing a judgment or opinion, thus retaining objectivity and neutrality."
Sunday night’s deadly Las Vegas shooting is once again starting up our country’s never-ending debate over gun control.,BIASED,"The sentence reveals a bias by using the term ""never-ending debate,"" which implies a sense of frustration and suggests that the discussion around gun control is fruitless or repetitive without progress. This choice of words carries a connotation of weariness and perhaps cynicism about the ability to find a solution to the issue of gun violence, thus inserting an opinion into what could otherwise be presented as a neutral statement. Neutral language would simply state that the shooting has reignited the debate over gun control without editorializing on the nature of the debate."
"Barrett, who is reportedly a member of an obscure group whose members swear a lifelong oath of loyalty and are assigned a ""head"" and ""handmaid"" that oversee many personal decisions, has said that a ""legal career is but a means to an end . . . and that end is building the Kingdom of God.""",BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it frames information in a way that casts suspicion on Barrett's character by emphasizing her association with an ""obscure group"" and highlighting unorthodox practices, like ""head"" and ""handmaid"" assignments. It implies her legal career is subordinate to religious goals by quoting that it is a ""means to an end"" for ""building the Kingdom of God,"" which could lead readers to question her impartiality as a judge without providing direct evidence of professional misconduct. This creates a prejudiced impression of Barrett's beliefs and motivations."
He was not asked by the event’s moderators about his family’s history of self-enrichment in connection with his former political position as vice president.,NOT BIASED,"The sentence delivers a factual statement without employing emotive language, subjective commentary, or judgments on the morality or ethics of the situation described. It simply states that the moderators did not ask a question about a specific topic, without hinting at any perceived wrongness or rightness of the situation. This straightforward reporting of an absence of action does not indicate a bias."
"In answering questions on everything from pollution to mental health, Warren returned again and again to her plan to tax the super-rich – including a wealth tax – to pay for a host of ambitious programs, including universal child care, student loan debt cancellation and tuition-free higher education.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence is classified as not biased because it presents factual information about the policy proposals of a political figure without using subjective language or expressing an opinion. It simply states what Warren's plans involve and how they would be funded, which is a neutral description of her platform without promoting or criticizing her views."
How the coronavirus pandemic shows that Christian white nationalism is a much greater threat to the US than radical Islam,BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it presents an unsubstantiated opinion that implicitly attributes a greater threat to ""Christian white nationalism"" while diminishing the perceived threat of ""radical Islam."" This comparison lacks a fact-based assessment and reflects a particular viewpoint without providing evidence. It assumes the coronavirus pandemic is linked to Christian white nationalism, which is a broad, contentious claim. Additionally, it generalizes and potentially stigmatizes entire groups without nuance, failing to differentiate between a vast majority of peaceful individuals and a minority who may hold extreme views. Bias arises from the subjective judging and comparing of complex social issues without objective analysis."
"However, the 45-year-old actor Joaquin Phoenix used his time on stage to call for his celebrity cohorts to put their money where their mouths are when it comes to climate change.",BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it implies a judgment on the part of Joaquin Phoenix's peers in the entertainment industry—suggesting that they are all talk and no action regarding climate change (""put their money where their mouths are""). It paints with a broad brush, assuming a lack of genuine commitment among celebrities without considering individual efforts. The phrase ""celebrity cohorts"" also carries a connotation of collusion or shared responsibility in not doing enough, which further imbues the sentence with a critical tone."
"Moreover, NeverTrump would not only have to separate Trump from his political base, but also to win the support of that base for its own candidate. That will be particularly difficult, as NeverTrump has made no secret of its general disdain for Trump supporters.",BIASED,"The sentence above is classified as biased because it contains subjective language that suggests a negative opinion towards the NeverTrump movement, notably in the phrasing that implies contempt (""general disdain"") for Trump supporters. It assumes the intentions and attitudes of the NeverTrump group without presenting evidence for such claims, thereby framing the movement in a negative light and suggesting partiality rather than a neutral perspective. Bias is indicated by the presumption of NeverTrump's feelings towards Trump supporters, which may not be uniformly held or expressed by the movement's members."
"Today’s mainstream media doesn’t want you to remember, but the early days of feminism were rife with ideological battles and  backstabbing that would put a medieval court to shame.",BIASED,"The sentence portrays mainstream media as having an active agenda against public memory and characterizes the early days of feminism in a hyperbolic and negative light, suggesting excessive conflict with words like ""rife,"" ""ideological battles,"" and ""backstabbing."" Such language is emotionally charged and presents a one-sided, judgemental perspective, indicative of bias rather than objective reporting. The comparison to a ""medieval court"" further dramatizes the statement, distancing it from a neutral, fact-based account."
"In addition to calling for severe funding cuts to Seattle police, CHAZ protests have been oozing with socialist slogans, propaganda and demands.",BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it employs emotionally charged words like ""oozing"" which conveys a negative connotation and suggests an uncontrolled or undesirable spread. Referring to messages as ""socialist slogans, propaganda and demands"" frames the protests in a pejorative light, suggesting they lack legitimacy or are manipulative. This language implies a judgement rather than providing an objective report of events, thus revealing a biased stance against the CHAZ protests and the associated political ideology."
"Given the shabby results Canada’s health system showed on health care access, it seems little wonder that the leftists at CAP failed to disclose these poor outcomes in their paper:",BIASED,"The sentence exhibits bias through its use of charged language and unfounded attribution of motives. The word ""shabby"" is a negative adjective that implies a judgment rather than an objective description. Referring to the group as ""leftists"" suggests a political agenda and discredits the organization by implying ideological bias. The accusation that CAP ""failed to disclose"" suggests deliberate deceit without evidence of intent. This language indicates a subjective viewpoint designed to persuade or influence the reader, rather than providing an unbiased factual statement."
Authorities have said Gendron promoted a racist conspiracy notion that white people are being replaced by minorities in America and elsewhere.,NOT BIASED,"The sentence is factual and does not express an opinion or take sides—it merely reports authorities' statements about Gendron's promotion of a particular racist theory. It avoids emotive language, making no attempt to persuade or influence the reader's perspective on the matter, thereby maintaining impartiality and factual reporting."
Chicago ended 2016 with more homicides than New York and Los Angeles combined – and the city’s former top cop is blaming the Black Lives Matter movement for contributing to the staggering tally.,BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it suggests causation (""is blaming the Black Lives Matter movement"") without providing evidence of a direct link between the movement and the increase in homicides, which is a complex issue likely influenced by multiple factors. The statement implies the accountability of an entire movement for the crime rates, potentially oversimplifying the issue and attributing blame without context. Additionally, the source of the claim being the ""city's former top cop"" could indicate a subjective view rather than an objective analysis."
"Most hobbyist rock climbers lack the basic rescue skills needed to save themselves in dangerous situations, a study suggests.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents a claim attributed to a study, indicating it is based on researched information rather than personal opinion. The use of ""suggests"" also implies the statement is not definitive but based on evidence. It does not employ emotive language or express a judgment, only reporting a finding related to hobbyist climbers' skill levels. As such, the sentence conveys a potentially factual piece of information without revealing bias or taking a stance."
"Having failed to contain a historic public health crisis and ensuing economic downturn, the Republican Party is running on a big lie, claiming against all evidence that ""Democrat-led"" cities are rife with crime and rioting and chaos, with fearful (white) residents fleeing in droves to safer locales in the suburbs. ",BIASED,"The sentence exhibits bias by attributing nefarious motives to the Republican Party (""running on a big lie""), suggesting that their claims are completely unsupported by evidence, and implying that their strategy relies on exploiting racial fears (""fearful (white) residents""). The use of charged language like ""big lie"" and the assumption that concerns about crime are unfounded and racially motivated suggests a partisan perspective rather than an impartial analysis of the situation."
"In Nevada, where candidates must appeal to miners and casino workers among others who make up the Democratic electorate, Biden faces a tough challenge from rival Bernie Sanders.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence provides factual information about the Nevada electorate, mentioning specific occupational groups (miners and casino workers) that are relevant to the voting demographic. It does not favor one candidate over another but simply states that Biden faces competition from Sanders. The language is neutral and does not contain adjectives or adverbs that convey a positive or negative judgment about either candidate, nor does it promote or criticize their policies or characteristics. Thus, it is classified as not biased."
"Retailers, pharmacies, liquor stores and other merchants across the United States are gobbling up insurance that protects buildings from damage caused by societal unrest, worried about possible street violence after the U.S. presidential election, insurers and brokers told Reuters.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence is factual, reporting on the actions taken by various businesses in response to a potential risk, without expressing favoritism, emotion, or judgement. It does not contain any adjectives, adverbs, or phrases that imply a subjective view or lean toward a particular perspective. Instead, it objectively presents the information about merchants acquiring insurance due to concern over a specific event (the U.S. presidential election), which is a verifiable action rather than an opinion or unsupported claim."
"Large majorities of both parties seem to like the Green New Deal, despite efforts by Fox News to paint it as disastrous.",BIASED,"The sentence exhibits bias primarily through its framing and language choice. It suggests that Fox News's efforts to portray the Green New Deal negatively are at odds with the favorable opinion held by ""large majorities."" This implicitly assigns Fox News a motive to mislead and sets up an adversarial relationship between the media outlet and public opinion. The use of ""despite"" signals that Fox News's stance should naturally influence public perception, yet it has supposedly failed to do so, indicating that the sentence writer may be attributing less credibility to Fox News's position on the matter."
"The United States should learn from China and “genuinely” protect human rights by restricting gun ownership, an editorial in a widely read state-run Chinese newspaper said on Friday.",NOT BIASED,"It's not possible to classify the sentence as ""not biased"" without additional context, as bias is determined by the presentation and framing of information. The sentence is an assertion from an editorial in a Chinese newspaper, which typically reflects opinions. If the newspaper has a history of promoting Chinese government positions, the call for the U.S. to restrict gun ownership based on China's approach to human rights may reflect that bias. Without knowing the newspaper's editorial stance or the broader context, it's challenging to definitively classify the sentence as not biased."
"""The constitution of the Russian Federation exists, and cannot be ignored.",BIASED,"The sentence is considered biased because it implies an opinion or position that the Russian Federation's constitution is sometimes ignored or not given due consideration. The use of ""cannot be ignored"" suggests that there are instances where it is, in fact, disregarded. This statement is not a neutral presentation of facts, but rather a normative assertion about how the constitution should be treated, hinting at a viewpoint on its current treatment within the legal or political framework of Russia."
President Trump is culpable in the preventable deaths of tens of thousands of Americans due to the evisceration of environmental protections in addition to the preventable deaths of tens of thousands of other Americans due to Trump’s disastrous response to the COVID-19 pandemic.,BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it uses charged language such as ""culpable,"" ""preventable deaths,"" ""evisceration,"" and ""disastrous"" to negatively frame President Trump's actions. It explicitly assigns blame to him for a wide range of deaths without considering other factors or perspectives. This emotive wording is designed to influence the reader's perception and implies a clearly negative judgment without presenting a balanced or objective analysis of the situation. Bias is often seen in language that portrays a subject in an unambiguously negative or positive light without providing evidence or allowing for alternative views."
The COVID-19 pandemic may be a unique situation where we can actually transform the economy to not only make it better for workers but also for the climate.,NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents an opportunity-focused perspective, exploring the potential for positive outcomes from a crisis. It does not lean towards a specific agenda, nor does it present one-sided information. Instead, it puts forth a hypothesis for the economy's transformation that could benefit both workers and the climate, without making definitive claims. This balance in addressing the dual potential benefits suggests an objective viewpoint rather than a biased one."
"China’s state-run propaganda newspaper Global Times repeatedly gloated this weekend over the widespread destruction by radical leftists in the United States, claiming on Monday that “Chinese netizens are cheering” looting and vandalism.",BIASED,"The sentence is biased as it employs loaded language and unverified generalizations. Words like ""gloated"" and ""radical leftists"" are emotionally charged, suggesting malevolence and extreme behavior without evidence. Claiming that ""Chinese netizens are cheering"" assigns a collective and uniform reaction to a diverse group without substantiation, inferring a monolithic view that may not exist. Additionally, portraying the newspaper's reaction as indicative of state sentiment propagates a single-dimensional perspective of a complex situation. Bias emerges from this framing that seeks to evoke a specific critical stance toward China and its media practices."
"Yet Biden finds himself in an increasingly competitive race with Sanders, the U.S. senator who came close to winning the 2016 Nevada caucus and finds support with some of the same voters.",NOT BIASED,"The sentence presents factual information without expressing favoritism or promoting one candidate over the other. It states that Biden is in a competitive race, notes Sanders' previous electoral performance, and mentions their shared voter base, all of which are verifiable facts rather than subjective assertions or value judgments. The neutral language focuses on the state of the race rather than evaluating the candidates, thus avoiding bias."
The Democrats’ plan is designed to aid the multiple refugee agencies that profit from high numbers of foreign refugees entering the country.,BIASED,"The sentence is biased because it presents the Democrats’ plan in a negative light, suggesting their policy is driven by the profit motives of refugee agencies rather than humanitarian concerns. The word ""profit"" conveys a commercial interest rather than altruistic reasons for aiding refugees and ""high numbers"" implies a troubling influx, without presenting evidence or the context for the assistance plan. This framing implies ulterior motives, potentially misleading readers about the nature and intention of the Democrats' policy."
